# Data metadata ðŸ¤¯

Precision is about ...

For all locations x and y is at zeros on the left hand side corner of our maps.

Note: iPhone hotspot used in the house and the apartment, had a dynamical MAC
address, that is, it changed each time it was turned on, in this data we just
made it the same after recording, but in a final solution, in this case it
would have to go off the SSID to find the real access point, which could be
unprecise.
